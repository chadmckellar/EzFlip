# EzFlip

EzFlip is a simple Windows application that allows users to quickly switch between active audio output devices using a global hotkey.

## Features

- **Global Hotkey Support**: Easily switch audio output devices with the press of a hotkey.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Runs in the background without consuming significant resources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- .NET Framework

### Installation

2. Compile the project using Visual Studio or any compatible IDE.
3. Run the executable.

### Usage

- Press `Alt + O` to cycle through the active audio output devices.

## How It Works

The application registers a global hotkey (`Alt + O`) and listens for it. When the hotkey is pressed, it cycles through the list of active audio output devices and switches to the next one in the list.
